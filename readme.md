For both of the assignments, please just use some basic out of the box styling, I'm not very interested in the styling part, but rather in the javascript/functionality part.
So don't spend time on styling. For both of the parts you can use the jQuery library.

First part:

Create a very basic HTML form and implement client-side input validation for the form.
This is a pretty basic assignment, but please try to structure your input validation code in a way that will be extensible and can be re-used for other parts of this amazing web app!
However don't go nuts with architecture things, I mainly want to see that you can structure your code in a way that makes sense and that it will be possible to extend it in the future.
  - The form should contain the following fields:
		- Name
		- Email
		- Website
		- Message
		- A submit button (it shouldn't actually post this anywhere, more like a trigger for the input validation part)
  - You should verify that the given input is indeed a valid email address.
  - The name and message fields are mandatory
  - The website field is optional
  - OPTIONAL: The website field should always contain at least the following parts
		- http://
		- some sort of string inbetween
		- A . domain part (e.g. .com, .nl, .gb, ...)

Second part:

Create a very basic slideshow that will show some random pictures fetched from an API.
 - For getting the pictures you should use a public API and fetch them using AJAX style calls.
 - Feel free to use whatever API you feel comfortable with, I quickly searched and found https://source.unsplash.com/ (just providing it as a suggestion).
 - The slideshow should only have 1 control for starting and stoping the slideshow.
 - Rotate in the slideshow in total 5 images.
 - Please don't spend a lot of time on styling!
